## [1.0.1] - 7/10/25

- Fixed an issue where `resp.BATCH` became undefined in `handleCanGenerateCodeSuccessUI` due to variable shadowing.
  - The response from `sendPostFetchWithoutBody(...)` was previously assigned to `resp`, overwriting the original response.
  - Now it is assigned to `postResp`, preventing the batch from being shadowed and ensuring `updateBatchHistorySection` works correctly.
  - This allows when the code is generated the record is also generated at the same time.



## [1.0.1] - 7/10/25
Removed if the conversion for native datetime to a string which could potential cause Django-q to choke
